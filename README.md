# 🎯 Employee Promotion Prediction System

## 📄 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning Model** to predict whether employees are eligible for a promotion based on their performance, achievements, and other attributes. The solution is designed to help HR departments make data-driven decisions while ensuring fairness and efficiency.

---

## 🔍 **Objectives**

- Develop a robust ML model to predict employee promotions.
- Handle class imbalance to ensure accurate predictions for underrepresented groups.
- Provide a detailed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to understand key patterns and relationships in the data.
- Train models with optimized features for better interpretability and performance.

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Tools Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
  - Oversampling: `imbalanced-learn`
  - Model Persistence: `joblib`

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### 🔹 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualizations included**:
  - Distribution of promotions.
  - Correlation matrix.
  - Boxplots (e.g., age vs promotion).
  - Histograms (e.g., training scores).
  - Promotion breakdown by department.
- **Insights**:
  - `avg_training_score`, `KPIs_met >80%`, and `previous_year_rating` are highly correlated with promotions.

### 🔹 **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer`.
- Converted categorical variables to numerical using `LabelEncoder`.
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.

### 🔹 **3. Model Training**
- Used **XGBoost** for classification.
- Addressed class imbalance with **SMOTE**.
- Trained the model with the full feature set and improved its precision and recall by balancing classes using **SMOTE**:


### 🔹 **4. Predictions**
- Deployed a script to predict promotions on new datasets.
- Outputs predictions in `predictions_hrdatatest.csv`.
